# Bezier Curve Pure Pursuit

Code utilizes the roboclaw motor controller to control robot movement. A four point bezier curve is used to generate a path enabling a robot with two degrees of freedom to account for three degrees of freedom. In this case, a differential drive robot can take in three parameters: x<sub>position</sub>, y<sub>position</sub>, end orientation.
